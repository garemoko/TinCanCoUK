<h2>History and the way ahead</h2>
<p>
	Before e-learning standards, there was no set way of launching and tracking e-learning content. Each LMS did things differently, and 
	e-learning content had to be designed to work with a specific LMS and then redesigned if the content ever had to move. SCORM solved this by providing 
	a standard way for e-learning content to be packaged up onto a CD and then onto the LMS. 
</p>
<h3>Project Tin Can</h3>
<p>
	SCORM was originally released back in 1999, and is <strong>starting to show its age</strong>. A few years ago, ADL - the organisation behind SCORM, recognised this. 
	They undertook some research and then commissioned a private company, Rustici Software, to come up with some ideas for a new e-learning standard. This 
	standard would be designed to use modern technologies and to suit the modern world of widespread internet, social media, smart phones and informal learning. 
	The result of this was Tin Can version 0.8, an early pre-release draft of the Tin Can specification.
	
</p>
<p>
	At that point ADL invited the rest of the community to get directly involved in development of the specification. Various organisations and individuals, including me, got 
	involved. Using wikis, forums, teleconferencing, Twitter and Github, we discussed, debated and argued to shape the specification into something usable and relevant to the 
	learning industry of the modern world. After two more pre-release versions (0.9 and 0.95) we released 1.0.0 in April 2013 with 1.0.1 following shortly after to tidy up the 
	typos and errors that got missed in the rush to the April deadline. 
</p>
<h3>Gaining adoption</h3>
<p>
	Adoption of Tin Can was growing even before the official launch of the specification. <strong>Most e-learning authoring tools</strong> have some basic Tin Can support and more and 
	more LMS are incorporating the standard all the time. There's a number of commercial LRS already on the market and doing lots of business. 
</p>
<h3>The road ahead</h3>
<p>
	Looking forwards to 2014, you can expect the Tin Can specification itself to remain stable whilst ADL lead the effort to develop a suite of LRS conformance tests. 
	Standards organisations such as IEEE are looking at taking ownership of the specification and turning it into a fully blown standard. We'll see the further development of 
	open source LRS such as learning locker and adoption will continue to grow and grow.
