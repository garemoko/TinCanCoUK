<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Tin Can is a new e-learning standard designed for the modern world. Released in April 2013, Tin Can is set to <strong>replace SCORM</strong> and is already seeing significant adoption.

Tin Can allows you to track <strong>any learning experience or achievement</strong>, including mobile learning and real world events. It enables you to compare and correlate 
learning experiences to <strong>workplace performance</strong> and craft deeply inter-related <strong>blended learning</strong> experiences.
