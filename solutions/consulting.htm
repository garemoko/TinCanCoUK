<h2>Consulting</h2>
<p>
	With a new technology like Tin Can, it can be difficult to work out where to <strong>get started</strong>. Or maybe you've got a great 
	idea for a Tin Can project, but you're just not sure how to <strong>make it a reality</strong>? Perhaps you've got specific questions 
	or need to <strong>bring in an expert</strong> for a particular project? Or perhaps you want to provide <strong>training</strong> for your team or 
	a <strong>briefing</strong> for your managers? 
</p>

<p>
	Whatever your consultancy requirements, I'd love to help. Take a look at the <a href="http://epiclearninggroup.com/uk/consulting/">consultancy services offered by Epic</a>
