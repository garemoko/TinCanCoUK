<h2>Learning Record Store</h2>
<p>
	Whatever you're doing with Tin Can, you'll need a Learning Record Store (LRS) to <strong>store your learning data</strong>. The LRS can sit within a Learner Management System (LMS), 
	or can be a separate application <strong>outside the LMS</strong>. If your LMS doesn't already contain an LRS, you'll need to get one. 
</p>
<p>
	Choosing an LRS can be a complex decision. Should you use a <strong>cloud based or hosted</strong> solution? An <strong>off-the-shelf product or a bespoke development</strong>? 
	Epic (the company I work for) are experts in learning platforms, including LRS. We can help you to work out <strong>the best solution for your organisation</strong> and then either 
	<strong>build your solution</strong> or direct you to off-the-shelf products as appropriate.
