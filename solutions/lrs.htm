<h2>Learning Record Store</h2>
<p>
	Whatever you're doing with Tin Can, you'll need a Learning Record Store (LRS) to <strong>store your learning data</strong>. The LRS can sit within a Learner Management System (LMS), 
	or can be a separate application <strong>outside the LMS</strong>. If your LMS doesn't already contain an LRS, you'll need to get one. 
</p>
<p>
	I'm on the technical board of open source LRS <a href="http://learninglocker.net/">Learning Locker</a>. If you need any help getting started with <a href="http://learninglocker.net/">Learning Locker</a> 
	or customising it to meet your needs, I'd <strong>love</strong> to hear from you.
