			<h2>Tin Canptivate</h2>
			<p>				
				I've had a few people recently asking about Tin Can support in Adobe Captivate. A lot of people use Captivate so this is an important topic. Here's the low down:
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="section">
			<h2>Update!</h2>
			<p>				
				Adobe have launched Captivate 7.0 this week which outputs Tin Can compliant content. I'm downloading a trial now and will update this guide once I've tested it out!
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="section">
			<h3>
				Does Captivate support Tin Can API?
			</h3>
			<h4>
				The short answer:
			</h4>	
			<p>
				No
			</p>
			<h4>
				The details:
			</h4>
			<p>
				The current version of Captivate, 6.1 can output to either flash or html5. Neither of these outputs support Tin Can. The next version of Captivate will be version 7. Adobe haven't said when this will be released, but it's probably not too far off. Will Captivate 7 support Tin Can? Maybe! Adobe haven't said either way.
			</p>
			<h4>	
				What it means for you:
			</h4>
			<p>
				If you want to use Tin Can API with Captivate then you either need to wait for Captivate 7 and hope that it includes Tin Can support, or build Tin Can support into the published course yourself. You could also continue to track with SCORM, and then have your LMS output Tin Can data, but then you're missing out on a few (but not all) of the advantages of Tin Can.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="section">
			<h3>	
				Can I make Captivate support Tin Can 1.0.0?
			</h3>
			<h4>
				The short answer:
			</h4>	
			<p>
				Yes
			</p>	
			<h4>
				The details:
			</h4>
			<p>
				One of my first experiments in Tin Can was to build a <a href= "http://tincanapi.co.uk/?section=code%20and%20samples">wrapper for Adobe Captivate swfs that outputs Tin Can API statements</a> whenever the swf tries to make a SCORM call. I've kept this up to date and whilst it's just prototype code, you can use it right now to send Tin Can statements from your Adobe Captivate courses. As far as I'm aware, my wrapper made Captivate the first authoring tool to be usable with Tin Can 0.9, 0.95 and most recently 1.0.0.
			</p>	
			<p>
				Note that this wrapper only works with the flash swf output at present. Quite a few of the people getting in touch are interested in tracking Tin Can from the html5 outputted courses.
			</p>
			<h4>
				What it means for you:
			</h4>
			<p>
				If you really want your Captivate flash courses to support Tin Can 1.0.0 and you've got the budget to do it, it's possible and I've already done most of the work for you. 
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="section">
			<h3>
				What about the html5 output. Can I make that send Tin Can statements?
			</h3>
			<h4>
				The short answer:
			</h4>	
			<p>
				Yes
			</p>
			<h4>
				The details:
			</h4>
			<p>
			The wrapper I've written won't work with the html5 output, but it could be a really good starting point and guide. I've not actually looked at Captivate's html5 output, but in theory this could be editted in the same way as the flash output to replace the SCORM calls with Tin Can API.
			</p>	
			<p>
			Another option is to build a tool that sits in a frame around any SCORM course and translates the SCORM calls into Tin Can statements. There are a number of technical and user experience challenges with this approach, but if you can get it to work, it could be made to work with any SCO, not just Captivate.
			</p>
			<h4>	
				What it means for you:
			</h4>
			<p>
				If you really want your Captivate html 5 courses to support Tin Can 1.0.0 and you've got the budget to do it, it's possible but will be more work than if you publish to flash.
