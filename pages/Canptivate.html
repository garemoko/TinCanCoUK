				I've had a few people recently asking about Tin Can support in Adobe Captivate. A lot of people use Captivate so this is an important topic. Here's the low down:
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="section">
			<h3>
				Does Captivate support Tin Can API?
			</h3>
			<h4>
				The short answer:
			</h4>	
			<p>
				Yes
			</p>
			<h4>
				The details:
			</h4>
			<p>
				Adobe have just released Captivate version 7 which comes with Tin Can API 1.0.0 publishing. Out of the box Captivate 7.0's use of Tin Can is pretty basic. It tracks all the stuff you tracked with SCORM previously, but with a little work and maybe a custom widget, you could have Captivate doing so much more with Tin Can. There's a couple of details of the implementation that I would change and improve on, but nothing major.  You can publish either swf or HTML5 courses with Tin Can tracking. 
			</p>
			<p>If you're interested, the here's the list minor gripes I have with Captivate 7's Tin Can reporting. Let's be clear though, I'm not aware of any other authoring tool that's doing a better job. If you're looking for a wysiwyg, off the shelf authoring tool to do Tin Can with, I recommend Captivate 7.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The Tin Can reporting simply replicates the SCORM reporting - there's no extra features or settings to take advantage of the more powerful applications of Tin Can. You could make widgets for these features though.</li>
				<li>Tin Can specifies what language text is in. There's no settings within Captivate that let you change that language from the defaults, or specify a range of languages. If you want to change the language you have to edit the published JavaScript output. You might be able to do it with a widget too.</li>
				<li>The reporting doesn't include an initialised or terminated event. You could add these yourself with a widget or by editting the published output.</li>
				<li>Statements relating to questions and the quiz don't get sent until you exit the course or close the window.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>	
				What it means for you:
			</h4>
			<p>
				You can use Captivate 7 to create Tin Can compliant SCORM style e-learning right now. Captivate also sets the foundation for taking things further with Tin Can using widgets and JavaScript.  
			</p>
			<p>
				Captivate 7 is currently (June 2013) my number 1 recommended rapid e-learning tool for Tin Can powered e-learning.  
			</p>

			<h3>	
				Can I make older versions (5 and 6) of Captivate support Tin Can 1.0.0?
			</h3>
			<h4>
				The short answer:
			</h4>	
			<p>
				Yes
			</p>	
			<h4>
				The details:
			</h4>
			<p>
				One of my first experiments in Tin Can was to build a <a href= "http://tincanapi.co.uk/?section=code%20and%20samples">wrapper for Adobe Captivate swfs that outputs Tin Can API statements</a> whenever the swf tries to make a SCORM call. I've kept this up to date and whilst it's just prototype code, you can use it right now to send Tin Can statements from your Adobe Captivate courses. As far as I'm aware, my wrapper made Captivate the first authoring tool to be usable with Tin Can 0.9, 0.95 and most recently 1.0.0.
			</p>	
			<p>
				Note that this wrapper only works with the flash swf output at present. Quite a few of the people getting in touch are interested in tracking Tin Can from the html5 outputted courses.
			</p>
			<h4>
				What it means for you:
			</h4>
			<p>
				If you really want your old Captivate flash courses to support Tin Can 1.0.0 and you've got the budget to do it, it's possible and I've already done most of the work for you. If you can though, I recommend upgrading to Captivate 7. 
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="section">
			<h3>
				What about the html5 output of Captivate 6? Can I make that send Tin Can statements?
			</h3>
			<h4>
				The short answer:
			</h4>	
			<p>
				Yes, but you're better upgrading to Captivate 7. 
			</p>
			<h4>
				The details:
			</h4>
			<p>
			The wrapper I've written won't work with the html5 output, but it could be a really good starting point and guide. I've not actually looked at Captivate 6's html5 output, but in theory this could be editted in the same way as the flash output to replace the SCORM calls with Tin Can API.
			</p>	
			<p>
			Another option is to build a tool that sits in a frame around any SCORM course and translates the SCORM calls into Tin Can statements. There are a number of technical and user experience challenges with this approach, but if you can get it to work, it could be made to work with any SCO, not just Captivate.
			</p>
			<h4>	
				What it means for you:
			</h4>
			<p>
				If you really want your Captivate html 5 courses to support Tin Can 1.0.0 and you've got the budget to do it, it's possible but will be more work than if you publish to flash, and probably more expensive than upgrading Captivate 7. I recommend upgrading to Captivate 7.
