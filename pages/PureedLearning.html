			<h2>Pur&eacute;ed Learning</h2>
			<p>
				If you went to a restaurant and ordered a dish that included "blended summer fruits" what would you expect? You'd probably expect to see some sort 
				of pur&eacute;e; there might be the odd lump of one berry or other, but generally the fruits would all be blended together so that you couldn't tell when 
				one fruit ended and the other began. When you taste your blended summer fruits, you'd expect a single flavour blended together from the various 
				ingredients.
			</p>
			<p>
				So why does blended learning often look more like a fruit bowl than a pur&eacute;e? All the ingredients are there, but there's no interaction between them. 
				The online learning operates completely independently from the face to face course, and the social elements are an optional extra tacked on at the 
				last minute. Learners are faced multiple separate learning experiences, rather than a unified single flavour.
			</p>
			<p>				
				One of the reasons this can happen is that responsibility for the different elements of the blend is divided up to different teams and little thought 
				is given to the design of the learning solution as a whole. True blended learning requires somebody to take responsibility of the overall learning 
				design and continued communication, collaboration and compromise between the teams producing each element of the blend.
			</p>
			<p>				
				Another barrier to pur&eacute;ed learning is technology. Face to face learning is tracked with registers and evaluation forms, online learning is tracked 
				with SCORM and social learning is rarely tracked at all. The classroom trainer often does not know about what's happening online, and the online 
				learning package has no idea at all about what's happening in the classroom or on Twitter.
			</p>
			<p>	
				A new e-learning standard called Tin Can due to be released on 26th April 2013 will change this. Tin Can allows any learning experience or achievement 
				to be tracked in the same way, so the different ingredients of your blend can be tracked together. More importantly, Tin Can let's learning activities 
				get the data back out, so each element in the blend can follow and respond to what's happening in the other elements.
			</p>

				your ideas about how Tin Can can help in your organisation and answer your questions about making it a reality.
