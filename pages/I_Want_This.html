			<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Introduction">Introduction</span></h2>
			<p>
				In a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.open-thoughts.com/2012/10/understanding-tin-can-api/#more-457">recent blog post</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://twitter.com/maberdour">Mark Aberdour</a> describes the need for Tin Can to track not just what we learn, but also what we need to learn and whether or not we are meeting those needs. Setting goals for learning allows us to evaluate whether or not we are learning the things that we set out to learn. It is standard practice for eLearning courses and qualifications to have learning outcomes attached to them, and these are used to measure if our learning has been successful. They are also used by educators and trainers to evaluate whether or not their teaching and training have been effective, and are used to inform interventions, further learning requirements and amendments to learning materials and lesson plans.
			</p>
			<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Learning_Goals_in_Tin_Can_API_v0.95">Learning Goals in Tin Can API v0.95</span></h2>
			<p>
				Learning targets and goals have actually already been considered as part of the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://tincanapi.wikispaces.com/file/view/Tin+Can+API+v0.95.pdf/365362588/Tin%20Can%20API%20v0.95.pdf">0.95 spec</a>. The relevant section is 4.1.4.3a - Statement as "object": Sub-Statements. This section does not immediately cry out "how to do learning goals in Tin Can", but that is the purpose of this section. The spec puts it this way:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				"One interesting use of sub-statements is in creating statements of intention."
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				Sub-statements therefore could be put to other uses, but the main reason they are included in the spec is to allow for learning goals.
			</p>
			<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Example">Example</span></h2>
			<p>
				The example statement given in the specification is as follows:
			</p>
			<div dir="ltr" class="mw-geshi" style="text-align: left;">
				<div class="xml source-xml">
					<pre class="de1">{
&nbsp;
    "actor": {"objectType": "Agent", "mbox":"mailto:test@example.com" },
&nbsp;
    "verb"&nbsp;: { "id":"http://example.com/planned", "display":{"en-US":"planned"} },
&nbsp;
    "object": {
&nbsp;
        "objectType": "SubStatement",
&nbsp;
        "actor"&nbsp;: {"mbox":"mailto:test@example.com" },
&nbsp;
        "verb"&nbsp;: { "id":"http://example.com/read", "display":{"en-US":"read"} },
&nbsp;
        "object": {
&nbsp;
            "id":"http://example.com/book",
&nbsp;
            "definition": { "name"&nbsp;: {"en-US":"Some Awesome Book"}}
&nbsp;
        }
&nbsp;
    }
&nbsp;
}</pre>
</div>			</div>
			<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Explanation">Explanation</span></h2>
			<p>
				There's a few important points to note about this statement, so let's take it line by line.
			</p>
			<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_parent_statement">The parent statement</span></h3>
			<p>
				The actor and verb definitions of the parent statement are your standard 0.95 actor and verb definitions. At the time of writing, the verb in the example "planned" has not yet been defined and would need to be defined somewhere before it could be used. Certainly the id "<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://example.com/planned">http://example.com/planned</a>" should not be used in any real code. If you're not familiar with verbs in 0.95, I would highly recommend taking a read of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://twitter.com/meganbowe">Megan Bowe</a>'s <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://tincanapi.com/2012/10/11/whats-up-with-verbs-in-95/">excellent article on the subject</a>. You are free to use any verb at all with sub-statements so don't have to stick with "planned" if you don't want to.
			</p>
			<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_sub_statement">The sub statement</span></h3>
			<p>
				The object property of the statement is where things get interesting. The "objectType" used here is "subStatement" because it refers to a statement within a statement. Sub statements are not full statements so do not have their own "id", "stored", or "authority" properties and are considered to be a part of the parent statement. For the sanity of LRS vendors, Sub statements can only go one level deep, and cannot themselves contain further nested sub statements.
			</p>
			<p>
				Whilst not explicit in the spec, I would also say that sub statements cannot contain the voided flag as there is no mechanism for voiding a statement which does not have an id, and defining the sub statement as void when creating the statement seems pointless. If the parent statement is voided, the sub statement should also be considered void.
			</p>
			<p>
				The actor of the sub statement could be the same as the actor of its parent, or could be different. Bob might plan to do something himself, but could also set Joe a target of completing a piece of learning.
			</p>
			<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Marking_statements_of_intention_as_fulfilled">Marking statements of intention as fulfilled</span></h3>
			<p>
				The sub statement's actor, verb and object should match exactly those of the expected future statement. A reporting system will then be able to compare this sub statements with future statements and flag up when the sub statement has been fulfilled. In this example, a future statement of "test@example.com read Some Awesome Book" would show that the intention of the sub statement had been achieved.
			</p>
			<p>
				The verb of the sub statement should therefore be in the past tense. This makes life easy for the reporting system, which can match verbs like for like rather than having to match up future and present forms of the verb. The form of this type of statement is "I planned (I did this)", not "I planned (I will do this)". Clever reporting systems may in the future be able to present this as future tense for a human reader, but the form within the statement should always be past.
			</p>
			<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Additional_Properties">Additional Properties</span></h3>
			<p>
				It is also possible for a sub statement to have result, context and time-stamp properties if required. The exact use of these properties for sub statements has not yet been defined, but I envisage these being used to further specify what is required to successfully fulfill the intention expressed by the initial statement. If for example a scaled score of 0.85 is specified in the result property, it would be reasonable to say that the initial statement is not fulfilled until a scaled score of at least 0.85 is reported. The "timestamp" property on the other hand might be seen as a maximum and used to specify that the intention must be fulfilled before a certain date and time.
			</p>
