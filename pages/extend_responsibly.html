    		<h2>Extend Responsibly</h2>
        <p>
        When you first start out with Tin Can, you'll most likely use existing verbs, activity types and extensions 
        from ADL. There will come a point where you will find a new use case that you don't have a verb for. After a bit 
        of research you discover that you're not the first to come across this use case, and somebody has already defined 
        a verb for this using a URI at some obscure website that you haven't heard of. The trouble is that so far all your 
        verbs have used the same base URI; they look nice and neat. Using a new URI would spoil that. And anyway, you've 
        never heard of this website before. Other adopters seem to be using the verb, but can you trust it on your 
        production system?
        </p><p>
        This blog will explain why uniformity of URIs doesn't matter, why it's vital that you do use existing URIs 
        outside your normal source of verbs and why it doesn't matter if you don't trust the website where the URI 
        is defined. I'm using verbs in this example, but everything here applies to any other type of Tin Can extension.
        </p>
        <h3>Interoperability is the main purpose of Tin Can </h3>
        <p>
        First, let's start with a bit of background on the purpose of Tin Can. At its heart, Tin Can is an interoperability 
        standard. It's designed to let learning content, tools and reports work together in a standard way. Tin Can means 
        that content developed by one vendor can be tracked by an LRS developed by another vendor and compared with data 
        from a tool from a third vendor in a report put together by a fourth vendor. This can also be helpful within an 
        organisation, allowing tools developed by different people, teams and departments at different times to work together.
        </p><p>
        Interoperability is a benefit of Tin Can that has not been heavily publicised, probably because it's assumed. Car 
        makers don't advertise that their car can be driven on roads to get places, because if it's a car that's a given. 
        Let's be clear though: if you have no interest in interoperability then Tin Can gives you no benefit. Tin Can gives 
        its adopters great freedom and flexibility, but it's still more restrictive than not following any standards at all. 
        If you are making a single tool that will never ever have to interact with any other learning tool or system then 
        don't use Tin Can.
        </p><p>
        If you do need your tools to work together, then Tin Can can help but is not the whole solution. It is possible for 
        two tools both to be certified Tin Can compliant and still not play nicely together. In order to achieve 
        interoperability, which is the whole point of Tin Can in the first place, we have to go beyond following the standard 
        and talk to one another.
        </p><p>
        Tin Can is only part of the solution The scope of Tin Can is huge. It allows us to track any learning activity or 
        achievement anywhere, including those which haven't been invented yet. Because of this, it's impossible to pin 
        everything down and the verbs, activity types and extensions you will need will vary depending on the activity you 
        are tracking. If you are tracking something common like a learner passed an online quiz, then you will find that 
        everything has already been clearly defined. If you are tracking something new, then these things won't be defined, 
        particularly in the first few years of Tin Can's existence.
        </p>
        <h3>The other half of the solution </h3>
        <p>
        When you do need to track something new, it's important that you use the same verbs, 
        activity types and extensions as other adopters who are tracking and will track the same things. If you use one verb 
        to describe an action and somebody else uses a different verb, reporting tools will assume you are talking about 
        different actions and your tools won't work together. You need to keep up to date with how others are using Tin Can, 
        and share your own use back with them
        </p>
        <h3>Why URI uniformity doesn't matter </h3>
        <p>
        It's at this point in the process where you might come across that verb I mentioned 
        in the introduction. The one that meets your requirements but doesn't match the URIs of your existing verbs. At this 
        point you might be tempted to try and keep a uniform set of verbs by creating a copy of the verb at your own URI rather 
        than using the existing verb.
        </p><p>
        All that you gain from this is slightly neater code. That's it. Verbs have a display property that is designed to be 
        shown to the user so they should never see the URI. The chef who only orders food with green packaging has uniform 
        kitchen cupboards, but these are never seen by the diners. The benefits of defining a new verb where one already 
        exists are extremely weak.
        </p><p>
        What you lose from doing this is interoperability, which is a big deal because interoperability is the whole point of 
        using Tin Can in the first place. By creating a new URI, you immediately make it much harder for your tools to work 
        with tools that are already using the existing verb.
        </p><p>
        This is bad news for your tools and bad news for the existing tools. If you are a large or influential organisation, 
        it could be even worse news for future tools. Down the line you might well be able to convince others to follow your 
        example so that their tools can work well with your tools. This will lead to a situation where there are two competing 
        verb URIs in circulation. New adopters will be confused as to which URI to use, and whatever they choose their tools 
        will only be compatible with half of the other tools out there. Ultimately most tools will resort to supporting both 
        verbs and seeing them as equivalents, which will work but be messy. All this because you wanted your URIs to match in 
        your code.
        </p><p>
        Clearly the best option for you and for the broader community is for you to use the existing URI.
        </p>
        <h3>What about security?</h3>
        <p>
        That's all well and good but what if you don't trust the website where the URI is pointed at. It 
        could contain all kinds of nasty things like viruses, cookies and sponge cakes. Worse still, it could be run by an 
        American government organisation, who we all know have been conspiring to cover up evidence of the aliens who steal 
        our left socks for years.
        </p><p>
        The good news is that you don't need to trust the website that the URI points at to use that URI because there is no 
        need for you to even visit that website. Remember too that your users will never see the verb URI either as they will 
        view the verb's display property. True, there should be information about the verb hosted at the website the URI 
        points to which will help you to understand what the verb means and how it should be used. If you've you've already 
        found the verb though, that means you've either already visited the site or have found it in a registry or profile, 
        so you've already got all the information you need.
        </p><p>
        Once a verb is defined and in use, it's creators really have very little power to do anything good or bad for the 
        users of that verb. Like that unflattering photo of you that your friend posted on Facebook and then went viral, 
        once a verb is out there, it's owned by the community and there's no stopping it.
        </p>
        <h3>Where can you find extensions?</h3> 
        So hopefully you are convinced that you should always reuse existing verbs, activity types, extensions and documents 
        wherever they exist. But how do you find them?
        <p>
        There are a few repositories and lists of verbs that already exist that you can use now. Over the next few months, 
        I'm working on developing a comprehensive repository system that will store any type of extension. The idea that 
        this will be a single system, itself powered by Tin Can, shared across multiple mirrored LRS.
        </p><p>
        The interface for this system can be included in any website or system, so my hope is that LMS vendors will choose to 
        include this as part of their admin interface and that there will be copies on all your favourite Tin Can API websites. 
        As these interfaces will all point to the same central web of LRS, you can be assured that wherever you access the 
        repository from, you are looking at the same shared list.
        </p><p>
        If you'd like to learn more about this system or contribute to developing it, please visit the project page on Github.
